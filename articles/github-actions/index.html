If youâ€™re already familiar with Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment as well as the distinction between the two, feel free to skip this next part.</p><h3>What is Continuous Delivery?</h3><p>Continuous Delivery is a software development discipline where you build software in such a way that the it can be released to production at any time<sup>[1]</sup>. In a Continuous Delivery workflow, each development change that is pushed to the main repository is ready to be shipped. However, the action of shipping requires human approval. Although there is usually a focus on automated testing as part of this process, in many organisations the risk of promoting a release to production is shouldered by the individual approving that release. Onus is placed on the developers to prioritise keeping the code deliverable over implementing new features.</p><h3>How does Continuous Delivery differ from Continuous Deployment?</h3><p>By contrast, in Continuous Deployment each development change that is pushed to the main repository is automatically released to production, without any human intervention. In this workflow, a strong emphasis is placed on automated testing, as it should not be possible to merge code into the main development branch without that code passing a test suite. This means that the quality of your test suite determines the level of risk for a release, and automated testing must be prioritised during development. As such itâ€™s important to ensure you donâ€™t fall into the trap of mistaking good code coverage in your test suite for good quality tests. Developers within the team must ensure that the quality of tests presented in code reviews remains high.</p><h2>Using Github actions for Continuous Deployment</h2><p>Now that we understand what Continuous Deployment is and what we are aiming for, letâ€™s create a workflow that builds a Docker image and publishes it to Docker Hub. To begin, youâ€™ll need to navigate to GitHub, ensure you are logged in and have opened the repository that you would like to work with. The repository should already contain a <code>Dockerfile</code>. Click the <em>Actions</em> button at the top of the page: <img src="/images/posts/github-actions-title-bar.jpg" alt="GitHub actions button"/></p><p>GitHub will prompt you to confirm that youâ€™d like to create a new workflow, click the <em>Create a new workflow</em> button: <img src="/images/posts/github-actions-create-button.jpg" alt="Git hook screenshot"/></p><p>Leave the name of the file as <code>main.workflow</code> and click the button labelled <em>Edit file</em> <img src="/images/posts/github-actions-heading.jpg" alt="Git hook screenshot"/></p><p>Add the following to the contents of the editor, replacing <code>&lt;project-name&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;docker-hub-username&gt;</code> with the name of your project and username for Docker Hub:</p><pre><code># <span class="type">Create</span> a new workflow thatâ€™s triggered by a push to master

</code></pre><p>That was a lot to digest, so letâ€™s take a look at the actions in this workflow. The workflow is trigged by any push to the repository. The first action filters out all pushes other than those to the master branch. It then attempts to login to Docker Hub using the credentials you have supplied as secrets.</p><p>Once authenticated, an action builds a Docker image, another tags it and yet another pushes it to Docker Hub. The next action is a filter, it checks if the push to the master branch was tagged as a release. If the push was a release then the next action tags the Docker image as latest and another pushes it to Docker Hub. Finally, an action zips the source code up and publishes it to the release page on GitHub.</p><p>To see all of this in action, commit the <code>main.workflow</code> file to the repository. Navigating to the actions tab should now show any in-progress builds as well as historical ones:</p><img src="/images/posts/github-actions-run-results.jpg" alt="Git hook screenshot"/><h2>References</h2><ul><li><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html        "Martin Fowler - Continuous Delivery"">Martin Fowler - Continuous Delivery</a></li></ul><p class="footer">Thanks for reading! ðŸš€</p></div><ul class="share grid compact"><li><a class="twitter" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=jimlearning&text=Continuous%20Deployment%20with%20GitHub%20Actions%20and%20Docker%20Hub&url=https://jimlearning.github.ioarticles/github-actions">Share on Twitter</a></li><li><a class="facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https://jimlearning.github.ioarticles/github-actions">Share on Facebook</a></li><li><a class="linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&&titleContinuous%20Deployment%20with%20GitHub%20Actions%20and%20Docker%20Hub=&summary=&source=&url=https://jimlearning.github.ioarticles/github-actions">Share on LinkedIn</a></li></ul></article></div><footer class="animated fadeIn"><p>Jim Learning Â© 2021.</p><p>Powered by <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a> and hosted on <a href="https://github.com/JimLearning/jimlearning.github.io">GitHub Pages</a>. 100% JavaScript-free.</p><p>Notice a broken link or other issue? <a href="https://github.com/JimLearning/jimlearning.github.io/issues">Open an issue!</a></p><p><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
